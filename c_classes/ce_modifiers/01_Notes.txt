Access Modifiers

Classes:
    - public        The class is accessible from any class
    - default       The class is only accessible by classes in the same package
                    When no modifier is specified, "default" is applied

Attributes, Methods, Constructors
    - public        The element is accessible from any class
    - private       The element is accessible only within the class that declared it
    - protected     The element is accessible within child classes in the same package
    - default       The element is only accessible by classes in the same package
                    When no modifier is specified, "default" is applied

Non-Access Modifiers

Classes:
    - final         The class cannot be inherited by other classes
    - abstract      The class cannot be used to create objects - objects must be created from subclasses

Attributes and Methods
    - final         Attributes and methods cannot be overridden/modified
    - static        Attributes and methods belongs to the class, rather than an object
    - abstract      Can only be used in an abstract class, and can only be used on methods. The method does not have a body,
                    for example abstract void run();. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).
    - transient     Attributes and methods are skipped when serializing the object containing them
    - synchronized  Methods can only be accessed by one thread at a time
    - volatile      The value of an attribute is not cached thread-locally, and is always read from the "main memory"
